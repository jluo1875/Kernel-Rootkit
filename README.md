# Kernel-Rootkit
## Description

This is a kernel rootkit for a 32-bit system, helping me understand how rootkits are made and work.

A big shoutout to these two books that helped me get a grasp on programming it!

"The Rootkit Arsenal: Escape and Evasion in the Dark Corners of the System" by Bill Blunden 

"Windows Kernel Programming" by Pavel Yosifovich
