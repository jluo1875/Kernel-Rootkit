# Kernel Rootkit
## Description

This is a kernel rootkit made to infiltrate a 32-bit Windows system. This project gave me a better understanding of how rootkits work and how they can be detected/mitigated. 


## Rootkit Features

This rootkit features the ability to:

-Protect Files (Read\Write\Create\Delete\Rename\Open\Execute)     
-Hide Processes    
-Protect Processes, Threads    
-Protect Registry Keys (Open\Create\Delete\Set)        
-Bypass Privilege Checks       

## Links/References

Big thanks to these two books that helped me get a grasp on programming and understanding how they work.
